       [4mNote[24m: glibc provides no wrapper for [1mipc[22m(), necessitating the use of [1msyscall[22m(2).

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mipc[22m()  is a common kernel entry point for the System V IPC calls for messages, semaphores, and shared memory.  [4mcall[24m determines
       which IPC function to invoke; the other arguments are passed through to the appropriate call.

       User-space programs should call the appropriate functions by their usual names.  Only standard library implementors and kernel
       hackers need to know about [1mipc[22m().

[1mVERSIONS[0m
       On some architecturesâ€”for example x86-64 and ARMâ€”there is no [1mipc[22m() system call; instead, [1mmsgctl[22m(2), [1msemctl[22m(2), [1mshmctl[22m(2),  and
       so on really are implemented as separate system calls.
